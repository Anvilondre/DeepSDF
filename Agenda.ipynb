    "## Main challenge\n",
    "It's difficult to model an accurate SDF. Most methods produce results with some lower-bound error rate, thus making it very challenging to actually evaluate the results, since we're approximating an approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommended order for viewing the notebooks\n",
    "1. Data sampling explained - my struggles with getting the data, and 90% of my time for this test task\n",
    "2. MyDeepSDF - my approach for SDF modeling with DeepSDF architecture\n",
    "3. (optional) Dataprep - notebook I used to transfer the data in needed format\n",
    "\n",
    "## The resources I've reviewed while doing the test task (there's a lot, so no description this time, sorry)\n",
    "Not all of them are directly related to this test task, but they're all connected to 3D rendering or representations\n",
    "### Videos (mainly listened as a podcast while doing the groceries)\n",
