## Main challenge
It's difficult to model an accurate SDF. Most methods produce results with some lower-bound error rate, thus making it very challenging to actually evaluate the results, since we're approximating an approximation.

## Recommended order for viewing the notebooks
1. Data sampling explained - my struggles with getting the data, and 90% of my time for this test task
2. MyDeepSDF - my approach for SDF modeling with DeepSDF architecture
3. (optional) Dataprep - notebook I used to transfer the data in needed format

## The resources I've reviewed while doing the test task (there's a lot, so no description this time, sorry)
Not all of them are directly related to this test task, but they're all connected to 3D rendering or representations
